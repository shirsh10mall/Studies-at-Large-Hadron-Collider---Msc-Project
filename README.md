# Studies-at-Large-Hadron-Collider---Msc-Project

Simulating particle collisions and generating data of physical quantities using MadGraph software. Performing
visualization, statistical analysis, sampling of data, and constructing new features using various software(Pythia, FastJet,
Deplhes, HEPMC, ROOT) and building predictive model using Machine learning, Deep learning algorithms,
TMVA(ROOT) to classify Signal and Background events.

 Data: The data were generated using the simulation software (Madgraph, Pythia, Delphes, and ROOT), used for
high-energy physics process at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In the collision of the two protons at the
LHC, the constituent particles (quarks and gluons) annihilate and produce different subprocesses. The
detectors surrounding the point of collision make essential measurements of various physical quantities
such as missing transverse energy, missing pseudorapidity, invariant mass, electron azimuthal angle, etc
of the final stable particle but the properties intermediate states are not observable directly. In a few
collisions, a Higgs or Z-bosons is formed, and such states are volatile, decay rapidly, and decay into lighter
particles until stable particles. We distinguish such a process by analyzing the features of final state
particles, which contain information about the immediate state
